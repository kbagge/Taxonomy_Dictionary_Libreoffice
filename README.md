# The Taxonomy dictionary
## Libreoffice extension

This repository contains the [Libreoffice extension](LINK) for [The Taxonomy Dictionary](https://github.com/kbagge/taxonomy_dictionary).
Instructions for installation and use can be seen below. For further specification on sources and compilation of the dictionary, please the Taxonomy Dictionary repository.

### Installation:
- Download the extension from the Libreoffice extension page.
- From within Libreoffice install the extension from file. Tools > Extension Manager > Add > Select the downloaded .oxt file.

### Use:
The dictionary can be accesed from within Libreoffice, and is installed as Latin language. It is possible to change the language for selection for each word that needs to be spellchecked. However I recommend the use of styles, as an easy way to change language and italicize the taxa correct (see below).
